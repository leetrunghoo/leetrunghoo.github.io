Having a website of your own equals entering into an invaluable communication environment. It doesn't matter if you have a personal or a business website, a website of your own can define your online profile in a way a social network presence can never do. And with a website, you can shape its appearance to exactly suit your taste and needs.

A website gives you creative freedom to express your personality in ways that are not be possible through your resume. Everything from the bio paragraph you write to the design options you choose for your website says something about you, and gives recruiters more chances to decide if they want to bring you in for an interview.

Having an informative, well designed website also sends a message that you take your career seriously.

Showing up is half the battle. We know that an ever-increasing number of employers are researching job applicants online, and owning your own website with your name in the domain gives you a great shot at showing up when someone searches for you.

Having your own website allows you to control what people will find when they search for you. When you have your own website, you have an opportunity to demonstrate a portfolio of information about you and to provide further information (via links) so employers can learn more about you.
