Having a website of your own equals entering into an invaluable communication environment. It doesn't matter if you have a personal or a business website, a website of your own can define your online profile in a way a social network can never do. And with a website, you can shape its appearance to exactly suit your taste and needs.

## Every job seeker should have a personal website

Employers find resumes boring, they had probably seen thousand and thousands of resumes already. Resumes are pretty annoying considering that they are always on a white sheet of paper with black lettering on them. All they see is a professional side of a resume, but believe it or not, employers go straight to google to find out more about you. That is where your personal website should come out.

Having your own website allows you to control what people will find when they search for you. When you have your own website, you have an opportunity to demonstrate a portfolio of information about you and to provide further information so employers can learn more about you.

A website gives you creative freedom to express your personality in ways that are not be possible through your resume. Everything from the bio paragraph you write to the design options you choose for your website says something about you, and gives recruiters more chances to decide if they want to bring you in for an interview.

Having an informative, well designed website also sends a message that you take your career seriously. On the other hand, if a site is unprofessional or contains content an employer will not appreciate, it can be harmful.

## You are establishing your expertise in your field

If you’re an expert in something, it’s time to show the world (in this case, the internet) what you’ve got. Like-minded people will approach you and you’ll even make new connections. That in itself is the new way of networking/socializing.

## For personal branding

The term branding has long been relegated to companies, but today almost every individual has a personal brand. What do you wish for people to associate with you when they think of your name? Once you understand how you wish your brand to be perceived, you can start to be much more strategic about your personal brand. And a website would help you to do that.

## Writing blogs will be beneficial for yourself.

A personal website that has your portfolio is just like an online CV, but if it also has blogs, it will be much better. As a software developer, I've learned new things every day. That's one of the reasons why I love my job: never feel bored when you still have tons of interesting stuff waiting for you to figure out. However, unless you take note about what you learned, you will forget them sooner or later. Sharing your knowledge also help others who have the same interest. You'll have more friends, and your website will have more views.

> "We learn by teaching" - Latin proverb

Blogging would help you to become a better writer and better thinker. You’ll live a more intentional life. Once you start writing about your life and the thoughts that shape it, you’ll begin thinking more intentionally about who you are, who you are becoming, and whether you like what you see or not. And that just may be reason enough to get started blogging.
