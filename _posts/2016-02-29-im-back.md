A half year ago, I started to make my website, but left it undone. Many things were happened, called life, yet I think the main reason is I was out of motivation. Today, I'd like to tell you my story, what I learned from my mistakes and hope it helps others.

As you know, personal website is important for personal branding, so I take it seriously. I want it to be as good as possible so I spent a ton of time for researching in order to show off an awesome website (and how awesome I am, of course :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). However, the more libs/frameworks I know, the more possibilities the web can be. It's like there are a milion decisions that I need to take. After days and weeks, I learned many new things, then I have new ideas for my website but actually I still did not code for my website. New features means the website need more time to be done, new framework was overkill for a web-page. Eventually, I got tired and lost motivation.

Meanwhile, I had many new ideas and wanted to start new side projects. But the highest priority is doing my personal website, so postpone them. Now I regret about that decision.

I've suspended this project for very long time, now I need to finish this, at all cost.
