Today I release my website with blog feature, there is only porfolio feature left. I'd like to share with you few thoughts about my website.

You may wonder what technology I'm using for my personal website, which scores **99/100** Google PageSpeed Insights (check it out: <https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fleetrunghoo.com>). 

People say we should not care about chasing a grade, 100/100 is not the goal, even none of Google's websites reach 99/100 (google search <https://google.com> just got 71/100 for mobile). However, trying to achieve as high score as I can is quite fun :smile: I've learned a lot about optimizaion. I can't get the last point because I'm using google analytics for tracking the visitors, and this is external lib that I can't control the cache expiry date. There is a way to work around but this is such a minor thing, I just don't want to solve :)) like they say "nothing is perfect", I'm happy with my website.

By the way, I would like to thank the authors and contributors of below awesome libs/tools/assets that help me a lot to build my website.
