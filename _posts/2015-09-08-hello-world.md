Well, today I start to make my own portfolio website! Wish my luck. :smile:

First of all, I would like to say hello to the world.

After reading [3 Easy Ways To Market Yourself as a Software Developer](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/06/24/3-easy-ways-to-market-yourself-as-a-software-developer/ "3 Easy Ways To Market Yourself as a Software Developer"){:target="_blank"}, I've planned to build this website to help myself stand out. It's also my side-project to experiment new technology.

I'll go into more detail in the next blogs.

The end of my first blog ever, haha.
