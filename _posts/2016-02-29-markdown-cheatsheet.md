## Introduction

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} was made by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber){:target="_blank"}, and he says:

> "Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid [XHTML (or HTML)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML "HTML5 and HTML/XHTML"){:target="_blank"}".

Let's take a look on how it works by the example I made on Codepen. The text on the left is writing in Markdown syntax and the output is on the right. You can play around by editing it:
<p data-height="480" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ZWEgew" data-default-tab="result" data-user="leetrunghoo" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/leetrunghoo/pen/ZWEgew/'>simple Markdown editor with Vuejs & Marked</a> by Trung Ho (<a href='http://codepen.io/leetrunghoo'>@leetrunghoo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Yeah, that's so simple, isn't it? :smile: If you write in HTML, it could be like this: 

```html
<h2>Introduce myself</h2>
<h3>My name is Trung.</h3>
<p>I'm <em>friendly</em>, <strong>funny</strong> and <del>fucking</del> <em><strong>handsome</strong></em>  ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p>I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning new things.</li>
<li>Making new friends.</li>
<li>Playing the guitar and the piano.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Find your passion and find a way to get paid for it." - someone said ðŸ˜‹</p>
</blockquote>
```

An advantage of writing content with Markdown is that it is free from the angle brackets and tags used in HTML, so it feels and looks more like "content" than "code". It is lightweight and superb easy to use therefore you don't need any [WYSIWYG editor](http://summernote.org/ "example WYSIWYG editor"){:target="_blank"} plugin. Markdown is a great choice when you focus on creating web content like blog or news.

Who are using it? A lot, I can give you two names [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/){:target="_blank"} and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help){:target="_blank"}.

GitHub uses Markdown with adding a few unique writing features for styling all forms of writing, called **GitHub Flavored Markdown** and this blog is talking about its cheatsheet.

    [Link with title](http://leetrunghoo.com "my website")
    [Open link in new tab](http://leetrunghoo.com "click to open in new tab"){:target="_blank"}
    Jump to the specified anchor point on the same page, [to the top](#top)
    This is [an example][id] reference-method link.

### Images
The syntaxt is almost the same with [Links](#links), just adding `!` at the beginning.

    ![Alt text](/assets/img/hero/trungho.jpg "Trung Ho")

![Alt text](/assets/img/trungho.jpg "Trung Ho")

### Lists

```
- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Ordered
1. Number 1
2. Number 2
1. Number 3
```

1. Number 3

Definition lists

    Apple
    : A kind of fruit
    : A computer company

Apple
: Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus.
: An american computer company.

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

```
Inline `code`
```
Inline `code`

You can create a standard block code by a tab space or "fences" 

    ```
    Sample text here...
    ```

Output:

```
Sample text here...
```

For syntax highlighting, write the language name after \`\`\`

    ```js
    var foo = function (bar) {
      return bar++;
    };
    console.log(foo(5));
    ```

Output:

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};
console.log(foo(5));
```

### Table

Colons can be used to align columns.

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

    Markdown | Less | Pretty
    --- | --- | ---
    *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
    1 | 2 | 3
