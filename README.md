Personal website, a static web built by Jekyll. 

It's still under construction :)

Todo: 

- [x] Landing page
- [x] Blog feature
- [ ] Portfolio
- [ ] Write more blogs :smile:


## How to run

Note: I changed to use Gulp for building & deployment Jekyll web instead of Bundle. Gulp is more powerful and easier to use. Need to change name (or delete) 'Gemfile' file to avoid error when running gulp task.

__Requirement:__ installed ruby, gem, nodejs & npm

1. Install github-pages for setting up and maintaining a local Jekyll environment in sync with GitHub Pages.
```
gem install github-pages 
```

2. Install all gulp dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Then run default gulp task. View gulpfile.js for more detail.
```
gulp
```
