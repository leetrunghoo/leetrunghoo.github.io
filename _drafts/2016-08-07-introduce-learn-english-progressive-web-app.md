[Learn English](https://learnenglish.leetrunghoo.com){:target="_blank"} is a Progressive Web App for learning English that I made for personal use and for learning new tech. I would like to share it to everyone, hope it helps.
For those who don't know what Progressive Web App means, I copy this definition from [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/)

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are:

- Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
- Responsive - Fit any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.
- App-like - Feel like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation because they’re built on the app shell model.
- Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
- Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.
- Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.
- Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
- Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
- Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.

Other cool features of this web app is it has Text-to-Speech (in case offline) and Speech-to-Text (to practise speaking).

## About the project:
- Firsly I need the content for my web app so I wrote a simple crawler/scraper runs on nodejs to scrape the data from <http://www.talkenglish.com>, then all json data are uploaded to Github.
- I want to keep this project simple and lightweight so currently I'm using: 
	- Service Worker (for PWA, and use sw-precache for generating sw file)
	- Jquery
	- Materializecss (CSS framework) 
	- Sass (preprocessor css) 
	- Masonry (for Masonry Layout)
	- Handlebar (html template)
	- Web Speech API
	- Gulp (automating tasks while deleloping)
	- Browsersync (for live-server & for testing UI in multi-devices)
	- Github Page (for hosting from your GitHub repository)
	- Cloudflare (for https & optimization) 

## How to run
__Requirement:__ installed nodejs & npm

1. Install all dependencies (in package.json).
	```
	npm install
	```

2. Then running default gulp task for development mode, without generating service worker for faster live-reload.
	```
	gulp
	```

	Or with flag --production when you want to have Service Worker.

	```
	gulp --production
	```
