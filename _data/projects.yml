  description:
  - Almost built up from scratch. I’m a big fan of lightweight and simplicity, therefore, I want to keep the UI clear & clean. I’m not a web designer but I don’t want my website is just a copy of others. So I’ve spent much effort for every detail on my website to keep it simple and cool.
  - Using Jekyll to build a static website that hosted by Github Page. In addition, CloudFlare is a free cloud service for https & optimization.
  - Using Gulp for building & deployment Jekyll web instead of Bundle. Gulp is more powerful and easier to use.
